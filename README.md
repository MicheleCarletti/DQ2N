# DQ2N
This repository is related to Parma University Master Thesis in Computer Science Engineering: "A Quantum Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Control Problem Solving".

It provides a Quantum Reinforcement Learning framework called Deep Quantum Q-Network (DQ2N), to solve optimal control problems, like the OpenAI Gymnasium CartPole environment. The model is tained via Q-learning algorithm.
